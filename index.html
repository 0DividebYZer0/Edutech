	<h2>WHAT WE THINK OF OURSELVES</h2>
	<h1>OUR DREAMS ARE BIG</h1>

	<p>EduTech Foundation is an Indian MOOC (massive open online course) which aims at providing tools required to excel in the 21st century. Our purpose is lucid - <span>we believe that everyone has the right to access knowledge</span> regardless of their social strata, race, colour, religion etc. Given that about 70% of the Indian population resides in rural areas and have restrained access to vital educational resources, we have come up with an unique solution.</p>

	<p>We conducted a survey, involving about 100 companies/ MNCs/ business houses asking them about the basic skills required to being job-ready in the 21st century. The survey data has been used to provide basic support to a defined target section. An introductory <span>set of 50 videos, with Hindi as the medium has been initially uploaded.</span></p>

	<p>The resources available on the website range from basics in Microsoft Office to fundamentals in Computer Programming, Web Designing besides English Language, Photoshop etc. These videos are integrated with test series and projects which will help anyone monitor their progress. These videos are accessible to all free of cost. We also collaborated with various NGOs/volunteer-schools and member institutions conducting workshops and live sessions on awareness in skill development. EduTech currently has a user base of <span>2100 users</span> and was also featured in the leading National newspaper of India, Times of India.</p>

	<p>The belief that <span>education and job opportunities</span> are the key to establish everyone on a common dias. We need to eradicate the sense of ignorance. This is possible through education bridging these differences in society.</p>
