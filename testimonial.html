			<p>Without hesitation, I recommend Divyansh Sharma unequivocally. He is a young person who cares deeply about the social implications of Technology and who has demonstrated this conviction through this and several substantial initiatives. I have never before written a recommendation for a student where the candidate and the opportunity were such a perfect fit. Divyansh has firm spiritual roots and an active, diverse, social life; he is loyal, committed, and clear-sighted.</p>
