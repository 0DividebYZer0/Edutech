			<h2>Saif Khan</h2>
			<h4>Software Specialist at Eastern Software Systems</h4>
			<p>Without hesitation, I recommend Divyansh Sharma unequivocally. His talents and motivations are not limited strictly to books, however. He is a young person who cares deeply about the social implications of Technology and who has demonstrated this conviction through this and several substantial initiatives. I have never before written a recommendation for a student where the candidate and the opportunity were such a perfect fit. I have known Divyansh from many years now. He has strong convictions tempered by good judgment and reason; he has firm spiritual roots and an active, diverse, social life; he is loyal, committed, and clear-sighted.</p>
